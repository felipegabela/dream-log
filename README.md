## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   cd dream-log
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Development Workflows

### Solo Development (Early Stage)

When working alone on the project in its early stages:

1. **Direct Development on Main**
   ```bash
   # Make changes and commit frequently
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **CI Protection**
   - CI pipeline runs on every push to main
   - If CI fails:
     - Code remains in the remote main branch
     - Branch is marked as "failing checks"
     - Vercel will not deploy the changes
     - You can push new commits to fix the issues
   - If CI passes:
     - Branch is marked as "passing checks"
     - Vercel automatically deploys the changes

3. **Best Practices**
   - Make small, focused commits
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Run tests locally before pushing
   - Keep the main branch deployable
   - Monitor CI status in GitHub Actions
   - Fix failing checks promptly

### Team Development (Later Stage)

When the project has multiple contributors:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests and linting:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run lint
   ```
5. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```
6. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
7. Open a Pull Request against the main branch

### Development Guidelines

1. **Code Quality**
   - Write clean, documented code
   - Add tests for new features
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Follow TypeScript best practices

2. **Testing**
   - Run tests before committing
   - Add tests for new features
   - Maintain test coverage

3. **Documentation**
   - Update README for new features
   - Document API changes
   - Keep comments up to date

## Testing

The project uses Jest and React Testing Library for testing. Tests are located in the `src/test` directory, mirroring the structure of the source code.

Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Future Improvements
